# Market_size_analysis_of_EV

## Problem Statement
-> As the demand for electric vehicles (EVs) continues to grow due to environmental concerns, government incentives, and technological advancements, stakeholders require accurate and data-driven insights to support strategic decisions. Understanding the market size, growth trends, and distribution of EVs is essential for manufacturers, policymakers, utility providers, and infrastructure developers. This case study aims to analyze historical EV registration data to estimate current market penetration, predict future growth, and uncover regional and model-specific patterns that influence EV adoption.

## About the Dataset
->The dataset consists of detailed records of electric vehicle registrations, likely focused on the state of Washington (WA), USA. It captures multiple dimensions of EV ownership and characteristics, with the following key attributes:

VIN (1-10): Partial Vehicle Identification Number.

County : The county in which the vehicle is registered.

City : The city in which the vehicle is registered.

State: The state in which the vehicle is registered. It appears that this dataset may be focused on Washington (WA) state.

Postal Code: The postal code where the vehicle is registered.

Model Year: The year of the vehicle model.

Make: The manufacturer of the vehicle.

Model: The model of the vehicle.

Electric Vehicle Type: The type of electric vehicle, e.g., Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV).

Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility: Eligibility status for clean alternative fuel vehicle programs.

Electric Range: The maximum range of the vehicle on a single charge (in miles).

Base MSRP: The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price.

Legislative District: The legislative district where the vehicle is registered.

DOL Vehicle ID: Department of Licensing Vehicle Identification.

Vehicle Location: Geographic coordinates of the vehicle location.

Electric Utility: The electric utility service provider for the vehicle’s location.

2020 Census Tract: The census tract for the vehicle’s location.

## Objective :
The primary objective of this analysis is to utilize EV registration data to:

Assess Historical Growth: Identify and quantify year-over-year growth in EV registrations.

Forecast Future Trends: Use historical data to model and predict future EV adoption rates.

Regional and Brand Analysis: Analyze distribution patterns across different counties, cities, makes, and models to identify high-growth areas and consumer preferences.

Estimate Market Size: Determine the current size of the EV market and project its growth over the next few years.

Support Strategic Decisions: Generate insights for key stakeholders—including vehicle manufacturers, infrastructure planners, utility companies, and policymakers—to guide production planning, resource allocation, infrastructure investment, and policy development.
